  "conclusion": "PARTIAL SUCCESS - Ensemble averaging DOES improve accuracy (consistently +0.01 to +0.03 score improvement). However, the implementation is consistently ~10-25 min over the 60-minute budget. The approach has merit but needs implementation optimization to be viable. Key finding: ensemble wins 90-100% of the time, showing weighted averaging is better than taking single best solution.",
