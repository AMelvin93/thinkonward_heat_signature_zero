  "abort_details": [
    "1. CMA-ES only optimizes positions (x,y). Intensity (q) is computed analytically via least squares - NOT optimized by CMA-ES.",
    "2. EXP_DD_CMAES_001 already tested coordinate-wise scaling (dd-CMA-ES) and FAILED. The 2:1 domain ratio (Lx=2.0, Ly=1.0) is too mild for coordinate-wise approaches to help.",
    "3. Low-dimensional problems (2D/4D) don't benefit from coordinate rescaling.",
    "4. The premise 'different sigma for position vs intensity' is invalid since intensity is not a CMA-ES parameter."
