    "Early stopping with 1% threshold for 3 generations NEVER triggers",
    "CMA-ES continues making >1% improvements throughout optimization",
    "No fevals are saved, so no extra polish iterations are added",
    "The overhead from stagnation tracking adds 5.4x to runtime",
    "Prior evidence (EXP_ADAPTIVE_BUDGET_001) confirmed: early termination hurts"
  ],
  "recommendation": "ABANDON early stopping approaches. CMA-ES needs its full budget to achieve good results. The optimization landscape does not exhibit early convergence."
