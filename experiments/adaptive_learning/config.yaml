# Experiment: adaptive_learning
# Adaptive Learning Tabu Search for heat source identification
# Created: 2024-12-20
#
# This optimizer combines 5 learning mechanisms:
# 1. Observational learning: Smart init from sensor patterns
# 2. Gradient learning: Descent direction from evaluations
# 3. Landscape learning: Adaptive step size
# 4. Curvature learning: L-BFGS-B polishing
# 5. Search dynamics learning: Adaptive tabu tenure
