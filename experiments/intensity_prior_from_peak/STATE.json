    "description": "Use physics to bound intensity search. Heat equation: T_max at sensor ∝ q/r². From observed max temperatures, estimate feasible (q, r) combinations to narrow search space.",
    "hypothesis": "Physics-based bounds on q might help narrow search"
  },
  "reason_aborted": "Based on a misunderstanding of current approach. Intensity q is NOT searched - it's computed analytically via least squares given positions. The Variable Projection approach already optimally separates position search from intensity computation.",
  "prior_evidence": {
    "variable_projection_separable": {
      "finding": "The baseline ALREADY uses Variable Projection implicitly - CMA-ES optimizes positions, q is computed analytically via least squares",
      "conclusion": "There is no intensity search to bound"

      "finding": "Physics-based initialization (temperature gradients) FAILED to improve over simple hottest-sensor approach",
      "conclusion": "initialization family EXHAUSTED for this problem"
    }
  },
  "technical_explanation": "For each candidate position (x,y), the optimal intensity is computed as: q_optimal = dot(Y_unit, Y_obs) / dot(Y_unit, Y_unit). This is a closed-form solution, not a search. The q_range bounds (0.5, 2.0) are only used for clipping, not search.",
