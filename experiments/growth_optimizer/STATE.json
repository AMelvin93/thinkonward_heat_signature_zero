  "conclusion": "ABORTED - Growth Optimizer is another metaheuristic without covariance adaptation. Pattern of failures (GA, DE, OpenAI ES, SA) proves that CMA-ES's covariance learning is essential. GO's 'learning' and 'reflection' phases are exploration/exploitation variants without correlation learning. Would require MATLAB-to-Python port for low probability of success."
