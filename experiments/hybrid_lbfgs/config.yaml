# Experiment: hybrid_lbfgs
# Hybrid Multi-Start L-BFGS-B Optimizer
# Created: 2024-12-21
#
# Combines:
# - Smart initialization from sensor temperature patterns
# - Multi-start L-BFGS-B for high accuracy
# - Diversity-enforced candidate generation (N_max=3)
#
# Goal: Achieve RMSE ~0.10 with 3 distinct candidates
# Expected score: ~1.21 (vs current best 1.16)
