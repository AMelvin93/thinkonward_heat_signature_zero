  "conclusion": "NOT IMPLEMENTED - Deemed not feasible based on prior findings. CMA-ES optimization overhead is only 0.2% of runtime (per fcmaes experiment). Implementing ADEI (4 population types, custom update rules) would require significant effort for minimal expected benefit. The simulation bottleneck (99.8% of runtime) makes optimizer algorithm choice largely irrelevant.",
  "decision_rationale": [
    "1. fcmaes experiment showed optimization is 0.2% of runtime (10ms vs 6000ms simulation)",
    "2. ADEI requires implementing 4 distinct population types (leaders/followers/contemplators/rationalists)",
    "3. No existing Python implementation available - would need to code from scratch",
    "4. Even with perfect optimizer convergence, simulation cost dominates",
    "5. Baseline CMA-ES already achieves competitive 1.1688 score",
    "6. Time better spent on other approaches"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Mark evolutionary_adei family as LOW_PRIORITY. Focus on simulation-reduction strategies instead of optimizer algorithm improvements."
