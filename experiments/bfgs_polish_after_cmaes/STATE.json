  "abort_details": [
    "1. EXP_HYBRID_CMAES_LBFGSB_001 tested L-BFGS-B polish and FAILED: 'Finite diff overhead (O(n) extra sims/iter) outweighs gradient advantage. Best L-BFGS-B: 1.1174 @ 42 min (WORSE than NM x8: 1.1415 @ 38 min)'",
    "2. EXP_POWELL_POLISH_001 tested Powell polish and FAILED: 4.2x over budget (244.9 min), score 1.1413 (worse than baseline). Coordinate-wise line search uses 5-17x more function evaluations than NM.",
    "3. BFGS requires finite differences for gradient (2n+1 extra evals per iteration for n-D problem).",
    "4. All alternative polish methods have failed. NM's simplex approach is optimal for 2-4D problems."
