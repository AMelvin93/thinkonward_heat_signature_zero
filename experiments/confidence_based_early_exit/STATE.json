  "conclusion": "ABORTED - Same idea as EXP_ADAPTIVE_BUDGET_001 and EXP_CMAES_EARLY_STOPPING_001, both FAILED. Prior experiments proved: (1) Early stopping NEVER triggered - CMA-ES continues improving >1% throughout budget, (2) Early termination hurts accuracy, (3) CMA-ES needs full budget for covariance adaptation. 'Confidence-based' exit is no different from sigma-based or stagnation-based exit."
