  "conclusion": "ABORTED - Multi-objective optimization is THEORETICALLY UNSOUND for this problem. The scoring formula already IS a multi-objective combination (score = accuracy + diversity). The baseline already balances these via multiple inits + dissimilarity filtering. Pareto optimization can't improve on optimizing the combined objective directly. Additionally, NSGA-II requires 200+ evals (pop=20 x gen=10) vs our budget of 20-36 evals."
