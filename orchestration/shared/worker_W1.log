=== W1 Session: 2026-01-29 ===

EXPERIMENTS COMPLETED:
1. position_only_perturbation - ABORTED (REDUNDANT)
   - Finding: Already implemented in baseline optimizer
   - VarPro already handles intensity optimally; perturbation is already position-only

2. validated_multi_candidate_perturb - FAILED
   - Multi-candidate perturbation (perturb_top_n=2) is WORSE than single-candidate (perturb_top_n=1)
   - Run 2 (multi-cand): Score 1.1407
   - Run 3 (single-cand): Score 1.1549
   - Baseline perturb_top_n=1 remains optimal

3. larger_perturbation_scale - FAILED
   - Larger scales (0.08, 0.10) do NOT improve over baseline (0.05)
   - Scale 0.05: Score 1.1549
   - Scale 0.08: Score 1.1469
   - Scale 0.10: Score 1.1506
   - Baseline scale 0.05 is optimal

KEY FINDINGS:
- Baseline perturbation config is optimal: perturb_top_n=1, n_perturbations=2, scale=0.05
- Multi-candidate perturbation doesn't help (2nd-best candidate's basin is not better)
- Larger perturbation scales don't help (current scale is optimal for this problem)

MACHINE CONSTRAINT:
- This machine runs ~4.5x slower than baseline
- Cannot reliably validate within-budget performance
- Relative comparisons are valid but absolute times inflated

FAMILIES EXHAUSTED:
- perturbation_targeted: Position-only perturbation is already implemented
- perturbation_v3: Multi-candidate perturbation FAILED
- perturbation_v4: Larger perturbation scale FAILED

RECOMMENDATION:
- Keep baseline configuration unchanged
- Remaining experiments unlikely to improve given pattern of failures
- Need faster machine to validate production-relevant timing

[W1] Session complete. 3 experiments completed. Baseline remains optimal.
